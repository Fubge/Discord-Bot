# Russian Fishing 4 Discord Bot

## Introduction

This is a small hobby project I created for the game Russian Fishing 4. It is a Discord bot that provides some basic information about different fish species, primarily focusing on the weight at which a fish becomes a trophy or a super trophy. The bot accepts input of the fish's name and returns relevant details.

The bot has already been updated with the new fish species introduced in the Northern Waters expansion. However, if you notice any missing fish or encounter any bugs, please let me know so that I can address them.

## Usage

To use the bot, you need to host the files on a platform like Replit. It is important that you replace the bot's token in the index.js file with the token of your own Discord bot. You can find information on creating your own Discord bot on the Discord Developer Portal.

The bot currently supports the German language as its primary language. However, if there is enough demand for it, I can consider incorporating an English language option in the future.

The bot will respond with the following information:

    Species of the fish
    Image of the fish
    Preferred bait and tackle (TBA)
    Suggested fishing locations (TBA)
    The weight at which the fish becomes a trophy or a super trophy

Feel free to explore various fish species and discover their trophy weight thresholds!

The above image shows an example of the bot's output for the two exaples. It provides relevant information about the fish and indicates that it becomes a super trophy at a weight of 4 kg.
